## SLIDE 2: THE PROBLEM

### Your Car Sits Idle 20+ Days Every Month

📊 **The Reality:**
- Average car in Bangalore: Used only 8-10 days/month
- Parking costs: ₹2,000-5,000/month
- Depreciation: ₹15,000-20,000/month (happens whether you drive or not)
- EMI: Running regardless

**Your car is costing you money even when parked.**

## SLIDE 3: THE OPPORTUNITY

### What If Those Idle Days Made You Money?

| Your Car | Idle Days/Month | Potential Daily Rate | Monthly Earning |

| i20 / Swift | 15 days | ₹1,500 | ₹18,000+ |
| Creta / Venue | 15 days | ₹2,200 | ₹26,000+ |
| Fortuner / XUV | 15 days | ₹3,500 | ₹42,000+ |

## APPENDIX: FAQ RESPONSES

**Q: What if a guest damages my car?**
A: Every booking includes a security deposit (₹3,000-5,000). Minor damages are covered. For major damage, we facilitate claims through your insurance. We document condition before and after every trip with photos.

**Q: Do I need special insurance?**
A: Your existing comprehensive insurance is sufficient. We recommend informing your insurer about occasional rentals. We're working on additional trip protection for extra peace of mind.

**Q: How do you verify guests?**
A: Every guest must verify their Aadhaar, driving license, and phone number before booking. They also build ratings over time, visible to you before accepting.

**Q: Can I reject booking requests?**
A: Absolutely. You have full control. See the guest's profile, rating, and trip purpose before deciding. No automatic bookings.

**Q: What's the minimum booking?**
A: You set this. We recommend 4 hours minimum, but many hosts prefer 24-hour minimum.

**Q: How do I get paid?**
A: Weekly bank transfers every Wednesday for the previous week's completed trips. Track everything in the app.

**Q: What if the guest returns late?**
A: Late return fees (₹200/hour) are charged to the guest and added to your payout.

**Q: Is this legal?**
A: We're operating under the peer-to-peer rental model similar to Airbnb and Zoomcar's host program. We're obtaining necessary permits in Karnataka.

## APPENDIX: OBJECTION HANDLING

**"I'm worried about wear and tear"**
> Every rental covers only X kilometers per day. Excess km charged to guest. Your car won't be over-driven. Plus, the income easily covers maintenance.

**"My car is financed/on loan"**
> That's fine! Most of our hosts are covering their EMIs through rentals. Just ensure your loan agreement doesn't prohibit third-party use (most don't for personal loans).

**"I've heard horror stories about Zoomcar"**
> We've heard them too—that's why we built GoDrive. Lower commission, better support, and fair damage resolution. Our 20% is half of what they charge.

**"I don't want strangers knowing where I live"**
> Pickup location can be a neutral spot—your apartment gate, nearby parking, wherever you're comfortable. You control this.

**"What if something goes wrong during the trip?"**
> We have 24/7 support. Guests have roadside assistance access. You're notified of trip start/end. We're a phone call away.
