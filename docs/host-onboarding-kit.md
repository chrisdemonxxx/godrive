## Host Pitch Script

### Opening (30 seconds)
> "Hi, I'm [Name] from GoDrive - we're a new self-drive car rental platform launching in Bangalore. We help car owners like you earn money from your car when it's parked idle. Do you have 2 minutes?"

### Value Proposition (1 minute)
> "Most cars in Bangalore sit unused 20+ days a month. With GoDrive, you can list your car and earn ₹1,500-2,500 per day when someone rents it. Our hosts typically earn ₹25,000-50,000 monthly - enough to cover a car EMI."

### How It Works (1 minute)
> "You list your car with photos and set your daily price. When someone wants to rent, you get a notification. You can accept or decline any request. Once accepted, the guest picks up from your location, uses the car, and returns it. You get paid weekly to your bank account."

### Address Concerns
- **"What if they damage my car?"** → "Every booking includes security deposit (₹3,000-5,000). We also verify guest DL and identity. Any damages are covered from the deposit."
- **"What about insurance?"** → "Your comprehensive insurance remains primary. We're also working on trip protection for additional coverage."
- **"Is this legal?"** → "We're operating similar to Zoomcar's host model. We're also obtaining necessary licenses from Karnataka RTO."
- **"What's your commission?"** → "We take 20%, you keep 80%. Much better than Zoomcar's 40%."

### Close
> "Can I take 10 minutes to show you how the listing works? I can help you create your profile right now."

## Objection Handling

### "I'm worried about strangers driving my car"
> "Completely understandable. We verify every guest's driving license and identity before they can book. You can also see guest ratings from previous trips. Plus, you can decline any booking request you're not comfortable with."

### "What if they don't return on time?"
> "Late returns are charged extra - ₹200/hour goes directly to you. If a guest is significantly late without communication, we help coordinate and can take action including blocking them from the platform."

### "Zoomcar is already doing this, why GoDrive?"
> "Zoomcar takes 40% commission. We take only 20% - that's ₹300 more per day staying in your pocket. We're also focused only on Bangalore with better local support, while Zoomcar is spread thin across 40 cities."

### "What about fuel?"
> "Guests return the car with the same fuel level they received it. If not, the fuel cost is deducted from their deposit. You can note the fuel level at pickup and return."

### "My car has minor scratches"
> "That's okay! We document existing condition with photos before listing. Any new damage from a trip is easily identified and covered from the guest's deposit."

### "I need guaranteed income"
> "We can't guarantee specific earnings - it depends on demand, pricing, and availability. However, our average active host in similar platforms earns ₹25,000-35,000/month. Start with weekends to test the waters."
